Starting Instructions:

Setup a basic CRUD API using Laravel. 
  -Fields must include: UUID, name, description,
   code and status (active and inactive). 
  -Leverage as much of the framework as possible
  -with as close to 100% code coverage (using PHPUnit) as possible.
Use Blade and VueJS with Vue-Bootstrap and Axios to build a website that does the
following:
  1. Displays a list of records
  2. Opens a modal to edit a record
  3. Saves record to the database
Bonus points:
